## üìÑ Project Overview

This repository documents the creation and deployment of a **URL Shortener** using a modern microservices architecture. The project demonstrates a complete DevOps workflow, from provisioning infrastructure as code to automated continuous deployment with GitOps, serving as a practical, production-ready skills showcase.

The application allows users to shorten URLs and track clicks asynchronously, ensuring high performance and resilience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and DevOps Pillars Demonstrated

| DevOps Pillar | Tools and Concepts Applied |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** | **Terraform** to automatically provision and manage the **Kubernetes (DOKS)** cluster on **DigitalOcean**. |
| **Containerization** | **Docker** to package each microservice (`Frontend`, `API Gateway`, `Worker`) into optimized images using **multi-stage builds**. **Docker Hub** as the image registry. |
| **CI (Continuous Integration)** | **GitLab CI/CD** to automate the processes of `linting` (Hadolint), testing, `building`, vulnerability scanning with **Trivy**, and `pushing` images to the **GitLab Container Registry**. |
| **CD (Continuous Deployment) & GitOps** | **ArgoCD** to implement continuous deployment. ArgoCD monitors a manifest repository and automatically synchronizes the cluster's state with the state declared in Git, following the **pull-based** paradigm. |
| **Microservices Architecture** | The application is decoupled into independent services that communicate via APIs and messaging, increasing resilience and scalability. |
| **Messaging and Caching** | **RabbitMQ** as a message broker for asynchronous analytics processing, and **Redis** as a high-speed database for URL mapping. |
| **Orchestration** | **Kubernetes** to orchestrate all containers, managing deployments, networking (`Services`), and data persistence (`PersistentVolumeClaim`) for **PostgreSQL**. |

## üèõÔ∏è Solution Architecture

The diagram below, generated with a "Diagrams as Code" approach (Python), illustrates the complete architectural flow implemented in this project.

![GitOps Architecture Diagram](architecture/Arquitetura_GitOps_-_URL_Shortener.png)

The workflow operates as follows:
1.  **Development:** The developer pushes code to the application repository on **GitLab**.
2.  **CI Pipeline:** The `push` triggers the pipeline in **GitLab CI/CD**, which executes tests, linting, builds, vulnerability scans, and pushes the Docker images to the **GitLab Container Registry**, in addition to updating the image tag in the **manifests repository**.
3.  **GitOps Deployment:** **ArgoCD**, running in the **Kubernetes** cluster, detects the change in the manifests repository and "pulls" the new manifests, updating the application in production without manual intervention.
4.  **Access:** The end-user accesses the application through a **Load Balancer** provided by DigitalOcean.

## ‚ú® Project Showcase

### üöÄ Application in Production
*The URL Shortener application, after a successful deployment via ArgoCD, is publicly accessible.*

### üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline (GitLab)
*The GitLab Actions workflow showing the successful execution of all stages (Quality, Test, Build & Scan, Deploy).*

### üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability Scanning in Action (Trivy)
*Evidence of the DevSecOps step, where the pipeline failed upon detecting `HIGH` severity vulnerabilities in the Nginx base image, blocking the deployment. The issue was resolved by updating the image tag in the Dockerfile.*

## üéì Conclusion

This project served as a practical, in-depth immersion into the modern DevOps ecosystem, transforming a microservices application into a fully automated system, from infrastructure as code with **Terraform** to continuous deployment with **GitLab CI** and **ArgoCD**.

The main outcomes were the creation of a resilient pipeline that ensures code quality and security, and the implementation of a **GitOps** workflow that makes deployments safer and more traceable.

### üöÄ Next Steps
* **Implement Load Testing:** Use tools like K6 to analyze performance under stress.
* **Add Full Observability:** Integrate the **Logging** (with the EFK/Loki stack) and **Tracing** (with Jaeger/OpenTelemetry) pillars for a 360¬∫ view of the system's behavior.
* **Cost Optimization:** Explore using **KEDA** (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling) to scale the analytics workers from zero to `N` based on the number of messages in the RabbitMQ queue.
